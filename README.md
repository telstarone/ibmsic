# modify the HTML
In this exercise, you will correct any mistakes in the existing code and also add any missing tags.

Doctype is missing. Add the doctype.

Add "Simple Interest Calculator" as title.

Move all the content which currently is in the <body> to a <div> tag.

Set the class attribute of this div to 'maindiv'.

Modify the input text box for interest rate to a slider using the <range> tag.

For the <range> tag set the attributes min to 1, max to 20 and step to 0.25 and the value to 10.25.

Range is an elegant way to input numeric input. But the drawback is that it does not visually show value the user has selected.

To show the value selected by the <range>, create a <span> element right after the range.

Inside the '` tag add the text "10.25 %".

Modify the input text box for "No of years" into a dropdown box with options 1 to 10.

Change the "Compute" button to "Compute Interest".

Below the "Compute Interest" button create an empty <span> and set its id to 'result'.

Add a copyright message using the <footer> tag.
